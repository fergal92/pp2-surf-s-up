## Design
### Colours
![Colour scheme](readme-media/coloors.png)
I used perplexity AI to generate colour schemes for Surf's Up. The colour scheme I decided to use was described as follows by Perplexity AI:

Coastal Vibes
Primary color: #00BFFF (Deep Sky Blue)
Secondary color: #F0F8FF (Alice Blue)
Accent color: #FFD700 (Gold)
This color scheme evokes the feeling of being near the ocean, with the deep sky blue representing the vast sea, the alice blue mimicking the color of the sky, and the gold adding a touch of warmth like the sun.

## Typography
For fonts I asked Perplexity AI to suggest fonts suitable for a surf based website. I chose the following set:

Tropical Escape
Raleway: A geometric sans-serif with a warm, inviting tone. It has a large family with many weights, making it suitable for headings, body text, and UI elements.

Yellowtail: A playful, bouncy script font that brings to mind tropical cocktails and palm trees. Use it for logos, titles, or short phrases.

Kalam: A hand-drawn, casual font with a handwritten feel. It works well for body text in a tropical-themed design
.

- [Iuliia Konovalova](https://github.com/IuliiaKonovalova) - My mentor Julia was very supportive during this project. She certainly pushed me to complete a high standard of project especially for the readme and testing sections. I took inspiration from her README.md and TESTING.md files for my own.
- [Happiness Generator](https://github.com/broken-helix/happiness/) - My first hackathon project. I learned so much from participating in this project and team. We won the March hackathon for 2024 and my team members were a great source of inspiration for me.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - I completed the freeCodeCamp responsive web design module before enrolling in code institute and I learned much from that module that I was able to utilise for this project.
