## Responsiveness
The website was checked for responsiveness using the [Responsive Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb). The index page with the data input form was tested. Then the index page with the surf game was tested. All pages worked as expected and were responsive. The website is fully responsive and has a mobile first design.
